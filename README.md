- 👋 Hi, I’m @amitaF-K, Fatima spelt backwords
- 👀 I’m interested in programming/coding, design, fitness and personal development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code - front end development to be exact, which stemmed from my interest in UI design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun, innovative and exciting. 
- 📫 How to reach me - best way is on email (fkalokoh55@gmail.com), I'm not on social media much. I do try my best.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can make my ears move and both of my thumbs are double jointed so I can bend them to the back of my hands. Looks concerning honestly
